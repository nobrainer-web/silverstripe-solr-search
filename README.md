# silverstripe-solr-search
Simple opinionated setup for using Solr search in a basic ss4 setup.

This package simply provides some out of the box functionality to get Solr search on your SilverStripe site.
For now, it uses Solr 4, as supported by the silverstripe/fulltextsearch module.

This also includes some cosmetic changes to `SearchForm`

```
composer require nobrainer-web/solr-search
```
